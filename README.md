# Project: [Flat Design] Transformation

**Jonathan Rojas - IS117**

This project transforms the base 'Bauhaus' website into a modern 'Flat Design' site, inspired by my research.

* **Live Site URL:** [Leave blank for now, or get from GitHub Pages later]

* **New Style:** Flat Design

## Design Direction & "Vibe"

My goal was to move away from the academic Bauhaus style and adopt a clean, simple, and modern Flat Design "vibe," as seen on sites like **Apple, Slack, and Spotify.**

My design philosophy for this project was:
* **No shadows, no gradients.**
* Simple, bold color palettes.
* Clean, different.sans-serif typography.
* Lots of white space.

## AI Collaboration Story: The 3 Key Changes

### 1. The Color Palette
* **My Direction:** I prompted the AI to rewrite `src/css/variables.css`. I asked it to replace the primary red/blue/yellow with a modern, dark-mode palette inspired by Slack and Spotify.
* **The Result:** The AI generated a new theme, and the "vibe" of the site changed instantly.

### 2. The Homepage
* **My Direction:** I told the AI that the `src/index.njk` grid was too complex. I directed it to rewrite the page as a simple, single-column "hero" layout, just like Apple's homepage.
* **The Result:** The AI refactored the HTML into a much simpler structure, which immediately felt more "Flat."

### 3. The Navigation
* **My Direction:** I instructed the AI to find the `<nav>` in `src/_layouts/base.njk` and replace its complex structure with a simple, horizontal list of links.
* **The Result:** The entire site's navigation was simplified, matching the new, clean aesthetic.
